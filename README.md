# Weather Journal app

## Description
The project creates an asynchronous web app that uses an external web API and the user's input to gather data and update UI.
Uses Node and Express to run on a local server.

## Prerequisite
If you don't have Node already installed on your machine, you can download it [**here**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
You will also need an API key for [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org/), which you can get [**here**](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).

## Installation
If Node is installed, then you can use the Node Package Manager to install the packages needed to run this program, which are express, body-parser and cors. You can run this command on your Terminal followed by the name of each package:

```
npm install
```
When those packages have installed, start the server with the following command.

```
node server.js
```
